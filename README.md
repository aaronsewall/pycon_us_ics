# PyCon US hosted calendar 

Conference info is available at https://us.pycon.org/2025/schedule/conference.json

All calendar files are tested to work and are importable by google calendar.

There are some other events that are not included in this conference.json (but most are at this point), which I manually made
calendar entries for inside google calendar. This calendar is available here (it doesn't follow the
same format as the generated calendars, and isn't as well maintained, but it helps to know about
other things that are happening).

all_events contains every event for the conference, but does not include open spaces.

You can also select based on the sections you're interested in or the kinds of events.

My preferred way is to subscribe individually to each calendar in the `kind` area so the colors
look better in google calendar.

Add them to google calendar here:
