# PyCon US hosted calendar 

Conference info is available at https://us.pycon.org/2025/schedule/conference.json

All calendar files are tested to work and are importable by google calendar.

all_events contains every event for the conference.

You can also select based on the sections you're interested in or the kinds of events.

My preferred way is to subscribe individually to each calendar in the `section` area so the colors
look better in google calendar.

The current files are stubbed for 2025 but did exist in 2024, so will likely be added later.
* kind/event
* kind/informational
* kind/poster
* kind/summit
* section/events
* section/posters
