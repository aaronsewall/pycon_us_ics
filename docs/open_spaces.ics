DESCRIPTION:An opportunity for software maintainers who are still supporting Python 2.x to talk with people who are still using Python 2.x. What do users need before we can migrate? What do maintainers need to know or get before we can fully deprecate 2.x support? What funding might be necessary to make these happen? A supportive and nonjudgmental discussion facilitated by Sumana Harihareswara.
