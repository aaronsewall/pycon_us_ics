BEGIN:VEVENT
DESCRIPTION:An opportunity for software maintainers who are still supporting Python 2.x to talk with people who are still using Python 2.x. What do users need before we can migrate? What do maintainers need to know or get before we can fully deprecate 2.x support? What funding might be necessary to make these happen? A supportive and nonjudgmental discussion facilitated by Sumana Harihareswara.

DESCRIPTION:Deployment is one of the sticking points in learning (and using) Django. [django-simple-deploy](https://django-simple-deploy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) solves this problem by automating deployment to a variety of hosting platforms. We keep up with each platform's docs\, so your deployment works the first time you try. If you'd like to learn more about the project\, offer feedback\, or start contributing\, please stop by!
