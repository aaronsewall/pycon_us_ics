DESCRIPTION:Deployment is one of the sticking points in learning (and using) Django. django-simple-deploy solves this problem by automating deployment to a variety of hosting platforms. We keep up with each platform's docs\, so your deployment works the first time you try. If you'd like to learn more about the project\, offer feedback\, or start contributing\, please stop by! I'll be sprinting on django-simple-deploy this week as well. Reach out with questions any time! (Eric Matthes\, ehmatthes@gmail.com )

DESCRIPTION:An opportunity for software maintainers who are still supporting Python 2.x to talk with people who are still using Python 2.x. What do users need before we can migrate? What do maintainers need to know or get before we can fully deprecate 2.x support? What funding might be necessary to make these happen?
