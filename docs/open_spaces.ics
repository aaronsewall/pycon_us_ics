DESCRIPTION:Python language implementations and tooling (interpreters\, compilers\, typecheckers\, linters\, codemods\, etc) are intimately tied to the details of the language\, and often to the internals of CPython. This leads to a large amount of work every time a new python version comes out\, to reflect the changes in the language.\r\n\r\nThis is a space for developers of these projects to compare notes\, and discuss ways in which some of this work can be developed more collaboratively. People interested in the space are welc…

DESCRIPTION:An opportunity for software maintainers who are still supporting Python 2.x to talk with people who are still using Python 2.x. What do users need before we can migrate? What do maintainers need to know or get before we can fully deprecate 2.x support? What funding might be necessary to make these happen? A supportive and nonjudgmental discussion facilitated by Sumana Harihareswara.
