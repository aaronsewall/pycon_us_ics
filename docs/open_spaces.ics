DESCRIPTION:An open questions session with Leonard Richardson\, the maintainer of screen-scraping library Beautiful Soup. If you've ever used or tried to use it\, share your questions\, confusions\, stuff you've made\, concerns\, ideas\, offers of help\, etc. with Leonard in person. If we don't have a ton of questions\, we might do some impromptu usability testing to check whether the new type hints help you use the library. Facilitated by Sumana Harihareswara.

DESCRIPTION:An opportunity for software maintainers who are still supporting Python 2.x to talk with people who are still using Python 2.x. What do users need before we can migrate? What do maintainers need to know or get before we can fully deprecate 2.x support? What funding might be necessary to make these happen? A supportive and nonjudgmental discussion facilitated by Sumana Harihareswara.
