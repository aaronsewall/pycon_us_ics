DESCRIPTION:Section: sponsor-presentations\nKind: sponsor-workshop\nName: Evolving Django: What We Learned by Integrating MongoDB (Sponsor: MongoDB)\nhttps://us.pycon.org/2025/schedule/presentation/142/\n<p>At MongoDB\, we have several Django enthusiasts who have jumped at the idea of backing a long-term solution to combining MongoDB and Django. Having historically provided support for SQL-based open source frameworks like Entity Framework in .NET/C#\, Doctrine in PHP\, and many more\, we are familiar with the territory.\nWe're happy to say we've successfully created a MongoDB Backend Library for Django and want to share all that we've learned kitting out a new NoSQL backend for a traditionally SQL framework including how we believe we have influenced -- and will continue to influence -- changes in the core Django library.</p>\nSpeakers:\nAnaiya Raisinghani\n<p>Anaiya Raisinghani is a passionate Developer Advocate at MongoDB\, where she empowers developers to turn their quirkiest dreams into reality with AI and Python. With her background in Computational Linguistics and Industrial and Systems Engineering\, she is all about exploring the niche between fun and useful by helping people build playful\, creative applications that can actually fit into real life (even through the chaos of it all!). When she's away from her laptop\, you can find Anaiya hanging out with her favorite coworkers (her two cats) or exploring all the fun brunch spots NYC has to offer.</p>

DESCRIPTION:Section: sponsor-presentations\nKind: sponsor-workshop\nName: Building AI Applications the Pydantic Way (Sponsor: Pydantic)\nhttps://us.pycon.org/2025/schedule/presentation/143/\n<p>AI is becoming an increasingly common part of software development\, but best practices for building and maintaining AI-powered applications are still evolving. Many developers are experimenting with LLMs\, but figuring out how to structure AI applications effectively—let alone debug and monitor them—can be a challenge. The good news? AI development is just software development—with a few unique twists. You don't need to reinvent engineering principles to work with LLMs\, but you do need the right design patterns and development tools to build reliable AI applications efficiently. In this talk\, we'll share an opinionated blueprint for AI development in Python\, covering both PydanticAI\, an open-source AI agent framework\, and Pydantic Logfire\, an observability platform that helps you understand and debug your AI applications. You'll learn practical techniques for structuring LLM-powered systems\, tracking and evaluating model behavior\, and integrating AI features into larger software projects—using familiar tools and proven patterns. Whether you're already building AI applications or just curious about how best to approach them\, this session will give you a clear\, pragmatic foundation for writing AI-powered software in Python.</p>\nSpeakers:\nSamuel Colvin\n<p>Samuel Colvin is a Python and Rust developer and creator of Pydantic. The Pydantic library\, which he created is downloaded over 300M/month and is a dependency of many GenAI Python libraries including the OpenAI SDK\, the Anthropic SDK\, Langchain\, AutoGPT\, instructor and LlamaIndex.</p>

Designed to help make differences between schemas and data clear and explicit\, DataComPy generates a comprehensive report at the completion of all comparisons\, providing useful metrics such as match percentages\, maximal differences\, and sample mismatches between comparable columns. In addition\, it supports various forms of input data types for both native (Pandas\, Polars\, Spark\, Snowpark) and indirect (Dask\, Ray) comparisons. It also supports comparison of certain types of database tables\, including Snowflake and DuckDB. Over the course of the presentation\, we'll be delving further into how DataComPy works\, what features it provides\, and what types of practical use cases it is designed to help address.</p>\nSpeakers:\nAkshay Gupta\n<p>-</p>\nRaymond Haffar\n<p>UWaterloo Comp Eng undergrad\, data science @ Capital One.

DESCRIPTION:Section: sponsor-presentations\nKind: sponsor-workshop\nName: Building Scalable AI Tool Servers with Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Heroku (Sponsor: Heroku)\nhttps://us.pycon.org/2025/schedule/presentation/3/\n<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) become vastly more powerful when given the ability to call external tools to gather information and take real-world actions - such as querying APIs\, modifying databases\, or kicking off workflows. This talk explores how to build and scale these tool servers using Python and the Model Context Protocol (MCP).</p>\n<p>MCP is an open-source protocol that provides a standardized request format and response structure for LLMs interacting with external tools\, ensuring consistency while allowing flexible execution under the hood. We’ll walk through implementing an MCP-compliant tool server in Python\, covering topics like transport types\, the connection lifecycle\, and best practices.</p>\n<p>LLM tool servers must handle increasing traffic efficiently\, requiring strategies for load balancing\, container orchestration\, and cloud deployment. We’ll discuss scaling Python services horizontally using load balancing and container orchestration. This includes practical considerations for deploying on 12-Factor App platforms like Heroku.</p>\n<p>Through live coding\, we’ll implement\, deploy\, and scale an MCP-compliant tool server using Python. We’ll also demonstrate how an LLM can interact with MCP tool servers\, enabling you to build powerful\, API-driven AI agents.</p>\n<p>Attendees will gain hands-on knowledge of building\, deploying\, and scaling Python-based MCP tool servers and AI agents\, made simple with Heroku’s streamlined deployment process.</p>\nSpeakers:\nKen Alger\n<p>-</p>
