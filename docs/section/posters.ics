DESCRIPTION:Section: posters\nKind: poster\nName: Data About Your Data: Open Source Python Tools for Scientific Metadata Management\nhttps://us.pycon.org/2025/schedule/presentation/49/\n<p>Within many scientific domains\, such as computational biology\, there continues to be explosive data generation. Along with this newly generated data\, also comes its associated metadata. This additional metadata is beneficial for scientific researchers\, because it adds context and enhances downstream data analysis.</p>\n<p>However\, with the surge of metadata\, there are now new challenges with sharing\, storing\, writing\, and integrating metadata into sample analysis due to the lack of metadata handling and standardization. This issue arises primarily because more focus has been given to the actual data rather than both the data and its metadata. These challenges affect numerous scientific fields including genomics\, astronomy\, and climate science.</p>\n<p>To solve this problem\, we present an open source python-based toolkit (PEPkit) for organizing large-scale\, sample-intensive scientific research projects and their associated metadata. We cover the entire life cycle of data and its metadata including: metadata capture\, storage\, standardization\, validation\, interoperability\, and shareability. We also discuss reusable data processing with its integrated metadata using workflow management systems (WFMS) that are metadata aware.</p>\nSpeakers:\nDonald Campbell\n<p>Donald is a Software Engineer at the University of Virginia\, creating open source tools for bioinformatics.</p>\nOleksandr Khoroshevskyi\n<p>-</p>

DESCRIPTION:Section: posters\nKind: poster\nName: Visual Prototyping for Woven Bands\nhttps://us.pycon.org/2025/schedule/presentation/127/\n<p>How do you create a custom design for a woven band in an unfamiliar weaving style? Weaving relies on repeating patterns\, so it can be easy to describe how a project should look\, but actually picturing it is a different matter. </p>\n<p>My goal was to design a band with diamonds\, mountains\, and other southwestern elements to be woven on an inkle loom. Plain weave on an inkle loom only uses repeating A-B patterns\, which doesnâ€™t allow for shapes like a diamond. I wanted to weave with a style where the pattern is built-in when you set up the loom with the warp\, rather than manipulated by hand for each row\, which is more error-prone. I'd heard of an A-B-A-C pattern style known as Turned Krokbragd\, which could work. This weaving style is originally from Sweden\, so finding existing patterns for my southwestern USA theme would be unlikely. </p>\n<p>This Python project let me visualize my own patterns\, try out different colors\, and add additional design elements like a border around a central pattern. The prototyping tool creates a more realistic visual by accounting for the physical spacing of the warp threads.</p>\nSpeakers:\nKathryn Born\n<p>Kathryn Born works with data analysis and visualization.

DESCRIPTION:Section: posters\nKind: poster\nName: Beautiful and Balanced: Using Color Theory in Data Visualization\nhttps://us.pycon.org/2025/schedule/presentation/48/\n<p>When presenting data visually\,  it's important to choose color palettes which do not skew the viewer's perception of the data relationships you're illustrating. Our brains interpret color contextually: proximity to other colors changes the way we perceive a particular color\, making it appear darker or lighter\, more prominent or more demure. With some understanding of these color relationships\, you can make palette choices which do not inadvertently introduce bias to the data being displayed.</p>\n<p>In this poster presentation\, we'll take a peek at some basic color theory based on the work of Josef Albers\, look at what color weight is\, and how you can use it to evaluate your palette choices. We'll go over some strategies for choosing color palettes that keep your data presentation both unbiased and visually pleasing\, and list some resources for learning more.</p>\nSpeakers:\nLaura Fisher\n<p>I'm an artist and designer\, living and working in downtown Los Angeles. I create work in traditional media like oil paint\, and in modern media like code. I am learning data visualization as a fun way to use both these skill sets simultaneously.</p>\n<p>Website: https://mitten.lol</p>\n<p>Fediverse: @mitten@social.lol</p>

DESCRIPTION:Section: posters\nKind: poster\nName: ExecExam: Streamlining Python Assessments with Automation and Personalized Feedback\nhttps://us.pycon.org/2025/schedule/presentation/46/\n<p>Assessing Python executable examinations at scale is challenging for educators who want to provide timely and actionable feedback to their students. Executable examinations\, where participants write\, modify\, or execute Python code to solve specific problems\, are widely used in educational environments to foster learning and evaluate student progress. However\, delivering accurate and constructive feedback on these assessments at scale remains difficult. This poster introduces ExecExam\, a tool designed to streamline and automate the assessment of Python programming tasks through Pytest integration\, enhancing student learning and the evaluation process .</p>\n<p>ExecExam leverages Pytest to automatically verify student solutions against pre-defined test cases but extends its functionality through advanced features such as tailored feedback reports\, a user-friendly interface\, and integration with large language models for enhanced programming advice. These additions make ExecExam more than just a Pytest test runner\, offering educators and students a comprehensive assessment and learning tool. The system generates detailed reports summarizing test outcomes\, highlighting successes as well as areas needing improvement. </p>\n<p>ExecExam also has an optional inclusion of large language models (LLMs)\, which provide students with detailed\, step-by-step recommendations on how to fix their code. With the integration of LiteLLM\, a unified API\, this tool provides sophisticated\, context-aware feedback for failing tests\, guiding students toward effective resolution of errors while fostering a deeper understanding of programming concepts. Unlike simply receiving a list of failed tests\, students can obtain specific suggestions for code fixes or alternative approaches that will pass the tests. This method cultivates a studentâ€™s programming education by giving them steps on how to improve.</p>\n<p>ExecExam helps instructors identify areas for improvement and empowers students to acknowledge their mistakes and enhance their skills. Currently used by college students and instructors\, this tool proves valuable in computer science education\, particularly for Python learners.</p>\nSpeakers:\nHemani Alaparthi\n<p>Hemani is currently a senior and a double major in Computer Science and Economics at Allegheny College\, where she holds a 4.0 GPA and has been recognized as a Distinguished Alden Scholar.

DESCRIPTION:Section: posters\nKind: poster\nName: From Monolithic to Mosaic: Collaborative SLMs Ecosystems for Cost-Efficient\, Scalable\, and Edge-Ready solutions\nhttps://us.pycon.org/2025/schedule/presentation/101/\n<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at tasks like filtering\, summarization\, and code generation\, but their high computational requirements lead to steep costs and limited scalability. This poster proposes a novel approach that breaks from the constraints of monolithic LLMs\, moving toward a lightweight ecosystem of open-source Small Language Models (SLMs) coordinated by a central Master Agent.</p>\n<p>In this architecture\, the Master Agent dynamically assigns requests to specialized Worker Agents\, each running an SLMs (Phi3\, Orca-mini\, etc) tuned for a particular function. By distributing tasks among smaller\, focused models\, we reduce resource consumption and cost. Scaling up or adapting to new tasks becomes as simple as adding or swapping Worker Agents\, avoiding the complexity and overhead of deploying an all-encompassing large model.</p>\n<p>Beyond cost and scalability\, this approach addresses the growing demand for edge-compatible solutions. Compact SLMs integrate seamlessly into edge devices ranging from IoT sensors to mobile apps which enables low-latency\, privacy-preserving\, and even offline language processing. This setup empowers developers to bring advanced language tasks directly to the user\, regardless of infrastructure or connectivity constraints.</p>\n<p>Our implementation\, primarily in Python and supported by open-source frameworks like Langchain\, Hugging Face LLMs\, etc. to foster community-driven enhancements. The poster will showcase how this multi-agent framework optimizes resource utilization\, simplifies maintenance through modular specialization\, and ensures robust failover for uninterrupted performance. Attendees will learn how to integrate these components into their own projects\, benefiting from a flexible\, future-proof platform thatâ€™s both affordable and adaptable.</p>\nSpeakers:\nRudraksh Karpe\n<p>Rudraksh Karpe is an GenAI Engineer at ZS Associates and a Google Summer of Code contributor with the openSUSE Project.

DESCRIPTION:Section: posters\nKind: poster\nName: Putting a Face to the Pattern: Applying Time-Series Classification & Clustering to Transmission Load Patterns\nhttps://us.pycon.org/2025/schedule/presentation/4/\n<p>In recent times\, Time Series-Based Machine Learning has been increasingly relevant to the utilities industry. As demand in electricity grows and new forms of electricity usage emerges\, so does the necessity to identify load growth patterns in real-time. As such\, while Time Series Classification and Clustering is still an emerging field of study in the Machine Learning space\, it has been one of the most relevant topics in the utilities industry. Efforts into applying Time Series Classification/Clustering in the utilities space\, specifically pertaining to load\, are ongoing\, with a mix of both successes and failures. Aided by packages such as Aeon and Numpy\, experimentation have included classification of existing load patterns through various models such as HIVECOTEv2\, DTW+KNN\, etc. at various granularities (yearly\, monthly\, etc.). Other experiments have included transforming load data into frequencies through discrete fourier transform and applying similar models. Some of the challenges faced have included classifying classes with low class priors (few cases in training data)\, identifying partial time series\, and identifying new load patterns in conjunction with existing loads.</p>\n<p>This poster intends to highlight ongoing experiments\, existing challenges\, and the packages used.</p>\n<p>Audience â€“ Machine Learning Practitioners/Enthusiasts\, People in Utilities\nLevel â€“ Some Experience</p>\nSpeakers:\nLaura Walter\n<p>Laura Walter is a senior lead data scientist in Advanced Analytics at PJM Interconnection with 20 years of experience in the energy industry.

DESCRIPTION:Section: posters\nKind: poster\nName: Infomaid -- An Offline AI Text-Generative Tool To Support Ethical Learning With Textual Assistance\nhttps://us.pycon.org/2025/schedule/presentation/144/\n<p>Generative AI technologies are gaining popularity as tools to assist users in managing and completing common textual tasks. However\, web-hosted AI tools create privacy concerns since users cannot safely experiment with their generative systems without leaving behind pieces of personal data.</p>\n<p>To address this issue\, we propose Infomaid â€“ an innovative textual AI assistant driven by the Ollama AI framework. This offline tool serves as both an AI teaching tool and a textual assistant that is free from Internet dependency. By allowing users to submit prompts and receive organized output reports in Markdown format\, Infomaid facilitates safe experimentation with AI-driven text processing\, generation\, and assistance.</p>\n<p>Written in Python\, Infomaid's modular design encourages users to experiment\, extend\, and customize its capabilities\, fostering a hands-on and diverse learning experience. To facilitate the archival (or publication) of results\, one of Infomaidâ€™s key features is the ability to document outputs in neatly structured Markdown files\, ensuring clarity and organization. This format enables easy integration into documentation workflows or collaborative projects.</p>\n<p>The Infomaid project\, hosted on GitHub as an open source project\, is designed for educators\, students\, and professionals who want to explore and learn about ethical AI-driven text processing\, generation\, and assistance in a safe\, private\, and offline context. Whether summarizing documents\, generating reports\, drafting content\, or organizing information\, Infomaid serves to simplify complex tasks and workflows into seamless operations\, making it a helpful resource for areas with limited Internet access or users prioritizing data privacy and security.</p>\nSpeakers:\nOliver Bonham-Carter\n<p>Oliver Bonham-Carter is an Associate Professor at Allegheny College at the Department of Computer and Information Science.

DESCRIPTION:Section: posters\nKind: poster\nName: Conformal Prediction: Quantifying Confidence in ML Model Predictions\nhttps://us.pycon.org/2025/schedule/presentation/7/\n<p>Machine learning models are powerful and helpful\, but their value increases when we understand how confident we can be in their predictions. Enter conformal prediction. Using Python libraries like MAPIE\, we can create upper and lower bounds of a prediction interval for point estimates. For classification tasks\, we can use the underlying probabilities of algorithms like logistic regression to understand how confident the model is in choosing a given outcome.</p>\n<p>From a practical standpoint\, obtaining a clear measurement of confidence like this allows practitioners to make relevant business decisions\, for example. A subscription service may decline to launch a new feature if its underlying model cannot classify user types with high confidence. Similarly\, a model that predicts monetary amounts won't be very helpful if the prediction intervals are especially wide and include extra noise.</p>\nSpeakers:\nAlexander Olden\n<p>I'm a senior data scientist at KUNGFU.AI\, with a focus on product analytics. I'm passionate about helping organizations understand their users through data. I'm also a former teacher who loves helping non-technical audiences understand technical material. Finally\, I've recently launched a blog on Medium called The Data Are Just Packed (bonus points if you get the allusion).</p>

DESCRIPTION:Section: posters\nKind: poster\nName: ClimateML: Machine Learning for Climate Model Downscaling\nhttps://us.pycon.org/2025/schedule/presentation/9/\n<p>Global climate models provide crucial insights but lack local precision\, limiting their practical application for regional planning and adaptation strategies. This poster presents a Python-based framework for climate model downscaling\, using deep learning to bridge the gap between global and local predictions.</p>\n<p>The approach leverages PyTorch's neural network capabilities and Python's scientific computing stack for processing complex climate data. The framework combines xarray for multi-dimensional data handling\, dask for distributed computing\, and custom PyTorch layers optimized for atmospheric pattern recognition. Through MLflow's experiment tracking and Panel's interactive visualizations\, we demonstrate how different neural architectures affect prediction accuracy across various regions and climate variables. This downscaling approach significantly improves prediction accuracy\, reducing the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) by 40-65% compared to traditional statistical methods\, with correlation coefficients (rÂ²) improving significantly for temperature predictions in complex terrain regions.</p>\n<p>By integrating domain-specific libraries like metpy with NumPy's computational capabilities\, we showcase how Python enables scalable climate science .Visitors to our poster can explore live examples showing how machine learning improves climate predictions. The implementation demonstrates how Python makes it possible to process large amounts of climate data efficiently and create accurate local forecasts.</p>\nSpeakers:\nNeeraj Pandey\n<p>Neeraj is a polyglot developer passionate about bridging different technologies.

DESCRIPTION:Section: posters\nKind: poster\nName: How to refactor with confidence\nhttps://us.pycon.org/2025/schedule/presentation/139/\n<p>Refactoring is a crucial part of the development process. But refactoring can be <strong>scary</strong>: how do you know that your changes haven't introduced subtle bugs? Perhaps your refactored code now raises an exception in some cases\, or has an edge case that returns a slightly different value. Unit tests can help\, but what can you do about <strong>unexpected</strong> differences in behavior?</p>\n<p>This poster will show you how to use <a href="https://github.com/pschanely/CrossHair">CrossHair</a>'s <a href="https://crosshair.readthedocs.io/en/latest/diff_behavior.html">diffbehavior</a> command\, your secret weapon for confident refactoring. CrossHair uses a constraint solver to efficiently find inputs that reveal discrepancies between your original code and the refactored version.</p>\n<p>Stop by to learn more about CrossHair's diffbehavior command and start refactoring with confidence!</p>\nSpeakers:\nPhillip Schanely\n<p>Phillip is a database and program language enthusiast.

DESCRIPTION:Section: posters\nKind: poster\nName: AmpliconFinder: A Python Based Bioinformatics Pipeline for Early Stage Cancer Diagnosis\nhttps://us.pycon.org/2025/schedule/presentation/44/\n<p>Early diagnosis is vital for significantly improving treatment outcomes for cancer patients\, as the chances of successful treatment and survival greatly increase when the disease is caught before it spreads. A promising area of research in early cancer detection focuses on tiny\, circular pieces of DNA called extrachromosomal circular DNAs (ecDNAs) or amplicons. These DNA circles are produced by tumor cells and can be identified in the blood or tissue samples of patients with various types of cancer. Recent advancements in DNA sequencing technology\, capable of generating individual sequence reads as long as 100 kb\, have made detecting these ecDNAs feasible. As sequencing costs continue to decrease\, ecDNAs are now being sequenced from thousands of patients\, creating vast datasets that require sophisticated computational tools for analysis.</p>\n<p>To address this need\, we developed a bioinformatics tool named AmpliconFinder\, which integrates a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on long-read sequencing data from cancer patients with a robust bioinformatics pipelineâ€”all implemented in Python. The tool leverages powerful libraries such as scikit-learn and TensorFlow for CNN development\, and pandas\, numpy\, and matplotlib for data processing and visualization. Circular DNA amplicons\, which serve as early-stage cancer biomarkers\, can be studied using AmpliconFinder\, providing a pathway for doctors to harness cost-effective sequencing data for simple\, non-invasive early cancer detection\, ultimately leading to more effective treatments.</p>\nSpeakers:\nHaque Ishfaq\n<p>Haque Ishfaq is a PhD student at McGill University and Mila - Quebec AI Institute.
